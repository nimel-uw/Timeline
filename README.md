This program categorizes sentences into three simple "tenses" using
a rudimentary tense logic (though there are only two tenses in english,
past and non-pase).

It reads strings from a file in the current directory, and uses
a Tk Canvas to display the results.

To run, use this command:

    python3 run.py
